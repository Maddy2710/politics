<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Machine Learning</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
The goal of machine learning is to make machines that can learn without being explicitly programmed. At its most basic, [machine learning] is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world,” defines this field of artificial intelligence Nvidia.

In other words, machine learning is aboutbuilding computer systems that automatically improve with experience and definingthe fundamental laws that govern all learning processes.

Machine learning is different from classical approaches to AI, which revolved around step-by-step rules written by programmers for machines to follow. Thanks to modern machine learning algorithms, AI-powered machines are mimicking the human brain and achieving things that were thought impossible just a decade ago, as demonstrated by the algorithm behind the recently sold painting.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Types of Machine Learning</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
Machine learning is a huge field, and there are many types of machine learning, but they can be broadly classified into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Supervised Learning</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
Supervised machine learning takes known sets of input data and uses these sets of data to train a model that can makepredictions about the future based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty.Typical applications for supervised learning include medical imaging, speech recognition, electricity load forecasting, algorithmic trading,and credit scoring
Because supervised machine learning algorithms have to be first shown the right answer from a set of sample data labeled by humans, they’re sometimes compared to small children who are taught to recognize objects using repetition. A parent may show a child dozens of different images of cars before the child can reliably recognize a car.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
Of course, children eventually reach a stage where they can learn how to identify new objects without receiving any help from their parents, or, in the case of machine learning, humans tasked with labeling large sets of data.

“The goal of automating machine learning is to develop techniques for computers to solve new machine-learning problems automatically, without the need for human machine-learning experts to intervene on every new problem,” says Jeff, a senior fellow with Google’s Brain Team.

The type of machine learning that is closest to achieving this lofty objective is unsupervised learning. More specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), a class of algorithms used in unsupervised machine-learning applications.

Instead of learning from data provided by humans, GANs canfindhidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data without knowing the right answers beforehand. Their applications include gene sequence analysis,credit card fraud detection, market research, and object recognition.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
Science fiction and even some people in the tech industrylike to depict artificial intelligenceas a potentially gravethreat to humanity. The reality is, at least for the time being, not nearly as alarming, but it’s certainly just as exciting. Machines have learned how to do many things in the last decade, and we can thank machine learning for it.

What Is ARKit?<br>
Do I Have to Use ARKit to Develop Augmented Reality Apps for iOS?<br>
Getting Started with ARKit<br>
Conclusion<br>

Augmented reality, commonly referred to simply as AR, has been one of the hottest technology buzzwords for quite some time now, promising to seamlessly blend virtual elements with the real world. But it wasn’t until September 12, 2017,that AR grabbed the attention of iOS developers around the world because that’s when Apple announced its new framework for creating augmented reality experiences, ARKit.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"><b>What Is ARKit?</b></h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">


ARKit is Apple's augmented reality development framework for iOS mobile devices. It combines advanced scene processing, camera scene capture, device motion tracking, and display conveniences to help developers create mesmerizing AR experiences using either the back camera or front camera of an iOS device.

The first version of ARKit was released on September 19, 2017, as part of iOS 11, the eleventh major release of the iOS mobile operating system. Since then, there were two major releases of ARKit: ARKit 1.5, which added support for 2D image detection, and ARKit 2.0, which extends this support to offer full 2D image tracking.


 
As a result of the improvements Apple has made to ARKit since its initial release, it’s now possible to use the framework to incorporate movable objects, such as 3D product renderings, into AR experiences and trigger them based on 2D images like posters, artwork, or signs. What’s more, the latest version of ARKit even makes it possible for multiple people to experience the same AR experience at the same time and come back to it later in the same state.

“We want everybody to be able to use AR, and so we've taken the complexity that developers would normally have to do in their apps and made it simple for them to convert all of their apps to an AR experience,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. “And the thing that is very different about Apple is that, in one day, we can make AR available for hundreds of millions of people.”
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"><b>Do I Have to Use ARKit to Develop Augmented Reality Apps for iOS?</b></h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

This question is easy to answer: no, there are many other AR frameworks on the market.

What makes ARKit the right choice for all new iOS developers is its first-class platform support (ARKit is compatible with all devices that run on iOS 11 and have A12, A11, A10, or A9 chips), fast and stable motion tracking, the ability to judge the amount of light present in a scene and use this information to apply the perfect amount of lighting to virtual objects, and more.

The biggest advantage of competing AR frameworks is their support for multiple platforms. If you would like to develop an AR app and release it, for example, both on iOS and Android without having to essentially rewrite it from scratch, you need a multi platform AR framework, which leaves ARKit out of the question.

Here are the top 5 multi platform AR frameworks you should know about:
Vuforia<br>



This market-leading AR framework supports iOS, Android, Universal Windows Platform, and Unity. Vuforia allows you to attach AR content to 3D models, images, objects with flat surfaces and multiple sides, cylindrical and conical shapes, products with rich surface details, and VuMarks. The framework handles background effects, video playback, virtual buttons, occlusion management, and many other things.

Kudan<br>



This Android and iOS augmented reality framework is perfect for all applications that demand excellent performance because it uses a high-performance engine and supports SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), which is a technology that understands the physical world through feature points.

ARToolKit<br>



If you’re a fan of open-source software, ARToolKit might just be the right AR framework for you. With its automatic camera calibration utilities, simultaneous tracking of several objects, OpenSceneGraph support, and a plethora of other features, ARToolKit simplifies AR development to such an extent that anyone can do it.

Wikitude<br>



Offering support for object and scene recognition, instant tracking, image recognition, location-based services, multiple image targets, extended tracking, cloud recognition, and 3D augmentations, it’s no wonder that Wikitude is a learning AR framework. Because Wikitude supports Android, iOS, Windows, and smart glasses, you can code your app only once and run it everywhere.

Maxst<br>



 Maxst is a multi platform AR framework that provides all the features and environments developers need to create game-changing AR apps. It’s priced affordably, and you can get started with it for free. Thanks to its extensive documentation and helpful forums, you should be able to get your first AR app up and running in no time.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"><b>Getting Started with ARKit</b></h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:green;">

There are a couple of things you need before you can start building AR apps for iOS using Apple’s ARKit:
Compatible iOS device<br>

To test your AR app, you need a compatible iOS device. We recommend you visit the iOS Device Compatibility Reference site to see which iOS devices are compatible with ARKit.
Mac computer
As you may already know, you need a Mac computer to develop iOS app, at least using without any third-party solutions. If you already have one, make sure that it runs macOS Sierra 10.12.4 or newer.

Apple ID<br>


You won’t be able to obtain Apple’s integrated development environment and publish your AR app on the App Store without an Apple ID, so make sure to create one here. Besides Apple ID, you should also register for an Apple developer account.

Xcode<br>


Apple has its own integrated development environment for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS, and you should use it. Xcode is available for free from the Mac App Store. ARKit is included in the latest version of Xcode, making everything so much more convenient.
With everything ready, it’s time to create your first AR app:
Launch Xcode and select the Augmented Reality App project template.
Choose options for your new project.
We recommend you choose Swift as the programming language, but you can also choose Objective-C if you already know it.
The selection of Content Technology is a little bit more complex, and this article provides a good explanation.
Preview the AR app on your iOS device by selecting “Window” from the top menu bar, clicking “Devices and Simulators,” and double clicking your iOS device.
The Augmented Reality App project template comes with a simple AR demo that displays a fighter jet in the air in front of your device’s camera.
To run your first AR app, click the Run option located in the top menu bar in Xcode.
You should see the app on your iOS device!
It’s beyond the scope of this article to describe in detail how to customize the sample app or build something similar from scratch, but we hope that you now understand that anyone can start developing AR apps in just a couple of minutes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"><b>Conclusion</b><h2>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:green;">

Augmented reality has the potential to fundamentally change our relationship with the world around us, and it’s up to developers to make it happen. Apple has done its part, releasing an augmented reality framework and software development tools that make it possible for anyone to get started developing interesting AR apps in no time, and we’ve explained just how accessible it has made AR development.

Benefits of Cloud Computing<br>
Conclusion<br>

Cloud computing has beena buzzword in the IT industry for a long time, and it has transformed the way we access, create, and share information.While cloud computing might feel like a new concept, it has been around for many years.

In fact, the 2018 IDG Cloud Computing Study revealed that 77 percent of enterprises have at least one application or a portion of their enterprise computing infrastructure in the cloud. LogicMonitor’s Cloud Vision 2020: The Future of the Cloud Study expects 83 percent of enterprise workloads to be in the cloud by 2020.


 
If you would like to better understand what cloud computing is and how it works, you have come to the right place. This article assumes no prior knowledge of cloud computing yet explains everything you need to know to benefit from this ground-breaking technology.

</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">What Is Cloud Computing?</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the cloud. What is the cloud? A metaphor for the internet that comes from the symbol used to represent the global computer network in flowcharts and presentations, a white cumulonimbus cloud.

Computing services that can be delivered over the cloud include everything from storage and databases to servers and networking to software and analytics. In the simplest terms, cloud computing moves these services away from your local hard drive and puts them on shared data centers. All you have to do is plug in, like a utility.


 
Even if you don’t realize it, you’re probably using cloud computing right now. From editing documents to watching movies to playing games,it’s almost difficult to find a popular software application that doesn’t rely on cloud computing in some way.

It’s estimated that nearly 2 billion people worldwide use cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, or Dropbox, and their number will likely increase to 2.3 billion by 2020. Entire businesses and business models have emerged around cloud computing, and everyone from tiny startups to large corporations and government agencies is embracing the technology for a variety of different reasons.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Just like there are different clouds in the sky, there are different types of cloud computing that you can use to meet your needs.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Public cloud</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Most people use various public clouds, which are operated by third-party cloud service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. For example, Microsoft Office 365, a line of subscription services offered by Microsoft, actually runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform.

Public clouds offer excellent scalability as they are backed by the servers and expertise of large technology companies. Their biggest disadvantage is the lack of control they give you over security and upgrades, which can be especially worrisome for companies and organizations that handle a lot of sensitive data.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Private cloud</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Whereas a public cloud can be shared by millions of different users, a private cloud is always used exclusively by a single user. The user may want to keep its private cloud physically located on its on-site datacenter, but a private cloud can also be operated by a third party and located in another country.

Private clouds provide total control, but they come with various responsibilities. They are often deployed for intra-business interactions and preferred by companies that want to maximize their data security.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Hybrid cloud<h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

As their name suggests, hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds and offer a solid middle-ground for those who require high operational efficiency but don’t want to give up their data security. With hybrid clouds, data and applications can move between private and public clouds depending on current needs.

Because of their technical complexity, hybrid clouds are more expensive to deploy than public or private clouds, but this disadvantage is largely outweighed by their long-term cost savings. Cloud compatibility can become a problem in hybrid cloud environments, which is why it’s important for businesses and organizations to plan well ahead.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Benefits of Cloud Computing</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

As already hinted at, cloud computing has many benefits that make it an easy choice for individual users and companies alike. Let’s take a closer look at some of the main benefits of cloud computing.

Speed: It takes a lot of time to set up an on-site data center. Cloud computing elegantly removes the need for time-consuming hardware installation, software patching, and other IT management tasks and makes it possible to provision vast amounts of computing resources in minutes, not days or weeks.
Cost: Because cloud computing services can be set up with just a few mouse clicks and in a matter of minutes, they eliminate the need for large IT staff. This is especially important for small companies and startups with limited resources, which are much better off focusing on their core business than spending money on IT.
Scalability:“Cloud computing can offer small businesses a lot of flexibility,”says Robert Epstein, head of small business sales and marketing at Microsoft UK. With cloud computing, it’s possible to scale IT resources elastically depending on current needs and reliably deliver them to the right geographic location.
Security: Only a small handful of businesses and organizations have the resources to protect themselves and their customers against the latest cyber threats.Everyone else can benefit from the resources and expertise of third-party cloud computing providers.
Reliability: Popular cloud computing services run on secure data centers with multiple layers of redundancy and worldwide presence. They can operate even in the event of a large-scale natural disaster and guarantee availability through Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

What Is Internet of Everything?<br>
Internet of Everything Versus Internet of Things<br>
Conclusion<br>
The world is growing more connected every day. By 2025, the number of connected devices worldwide is projected to reach 75 billion, or around 10 times the number of humans on Earth. One of the main drivers of this astonishing increase ineveryday connectivity, which will impact everything from city planning to first responders to healthcare, is the Internet of Everything.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">What Is Internet of Everything?</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

The term Internet of Everything, or IoE for short, was coined by Cisco in 2013, which describes it as the amalgamation of “people, process, data, and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before-turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals, and countries.”

By 2015, the IoE was already listed as one of the top trends of the year by Gartner. Since then, the global IoE market has grown exponentially, and it’s estimated to reach $23.97 trillion by 2020, at a compound annual growth rateof 15 percent.


 
The IoE is expected to reinvent virtually all industries at every level. From real-time, multidimensional data analysis in manufacturing to integration of sensor data, ability to direct staff, and predictive analytics in city management to customer behavior analysis, data analytics, and visualization in retail, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the world will be a different place just a few years from now, and the IoE will be largely responsible for its change.

To really understand where the value of the IoE is coming from, it’s helpful to take a closer look at its key components:

Peopleare the users of the connected devices that represent the individual cells forming the IoE. As such, a bulk of the data generated by connected devices is actually about people, their health, work habits, or personal preferences, just to give a few examples.
Processes make it possible for individuals, businesses, cities, and even whole countries to fully realize the benefits of the IoT. They are the connective tissue that binds the billions of connected devices together and makes them far more useful than they would be on their own.
Datacoming from a number of different sources, including personal healthcare devices, industrial machinery, security systems, or connected vehicles is the main product of the IoE. When properly classified and analyzed, data provides insights that can help businesses in decision making and improving processes.
Things are the foundational layer of the IoE. They are the various physical devices and connected objects that are often grouped together and called the Internet of Things (IoT).
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Internet of Everything Versus Internet of Things</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

The Internet of Everything is sometimes considered synonymous with the Internet of Things, but the two are completely distinct, even if closely relatedconcepts.

“In some ways, you can see the Internet of Things as the equivalent of a railroad line, including the tracks and the connections, whereas the Internet of Everything is all of that, and the trains, ticket machines, staff, customers, weather conditions, etc.,” explains CloudRail’s online marketing manager Luke Simmons.

As we’ve already explained, the IoE has four pillars—people, process, data, and things—and the IoT is the last one of them. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
Conclusion
The Internet of Everything, which is commonly described as the networked connection of people, process, data, and things, is quickly emerging as the next stage of digitalization, and experts predict that its impact will reach virtually every industry. But as the world gets more connected and becomes more data-driven, we mustn’t forget to pay sufficient attention to the privacy and security challenges that will inevitably arise.

<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
What is WordPress?<br>
 If you haven’t already heard of it, then WordPress is the world’s largest open source Content Management System. This is a somewhat technical way of saying that it’s the best way you can build your business website. More than 75 million different sites have been created with it which is as good a reason as any to get on board. It offers economies of scale in the form free installation, deployment, and automatic upgrades.  

There is also an ever-expanding library of templates and plugins that allow you to add new functionality to your site such as booking forms and the ability to accept PayPal payments. This guide will talk you through everything you need to master WordPress and get up and running by this evening. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Hosting: What does it mean and is it overly expensive?</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

 We’ve already covered WordPress: it’s the platform that allows you to build your website. Now you need to think about a hosting service. Hosting is when a company gives you access to their internet servers so that anyone who searches for it can see your website. Skip this step,andyou will not have a home for your site.
</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">More competition means lower hosting prices</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

The next thing to think about is the price. Just because this sounds like something you could never envisage doing without external help,it doesn’t mean that it should be overly expensive. In fact, because of the rise of eCommerce and the sheer number of businesses who are now building websites, hosting has never been cheaper. With plenty of competition for your attention companies have been forced to lower their prices.

For the purpose of basic business website, you can get hosting (website space,) dedicated email addresses, WordPress installed, and a unique domain name for just $1.99 per month. 

Hurray for net neutrality!
 You may ask yourself if anyone will ever see your site if you’re competing against the larger competition? The great thing about the internet is that it’s governed by something called ‘net neutrality’ which ensures free and fair access to all. Now, all we need to do is get started setting up your host! 
</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Choosing your host: budget vs. functionality</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

 Now that you’re ready to get started you’ll want to survey the landscape and see what you can get for your money. What I like to do is work with the functionality I need in mind, and find something within my budget that will fulfill my business needs. If you focus too much on what you can afford then you can run the risk of not thinking about what specific functionality you need to have at the end of it all.

If in doubt: future proof so that there’s plenty of scope for your site to expandwhen your business really takes off!
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Deciding on the right functionality </h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
 
This is where you need to have a clear idea of what type of site you want to build. At this point, you’ll be making decisions regarding how much storage and how many WordPress projects you can include in your hosting package. There’s also the super important task of picking the domain that will be your www. address! Here’s a quick numbered list for you to work through to keep things simple… 

1. How many WordPress projects do you want to host?
Focus is everything, so while learning, one site should be your priority! 

2. How much storage do you want?
 That depends on whether you want to add lots of photos and video to your site so plan for a bit of expansion. Plenty of hosting services will offer you 50 GB of storage with their basic packages which is more than enough to get you up and working. Your data will either be stored on an SSD or in The Cloud. Either technology is suitable for what we’re trying to do. 

3. Avoid visitor limits!
 Some hosts will cap the number of visitors you can receive on their more basic packages. That is, sothey do not undercharge for something that goes viral. Make sure to pick an unlimited option (there are loads out there),and you won’t run the risk of missing out on new customers and leads overnight. 

4. Managed WordPress Hosting is super important.
 Always select a Managed WordPress host if you want to ensure you automatically receive security updates. This will ensure that browsers are safe on your site and is the best way to minimize costly downtime. If in doubt, opt for additional security. 

5. Security is key!
Perhaps the most important aspect of selecting a host is checking their security credentials. Opt for a package that offers full data recovery and comes with an SSL Certificate and you’ll be safe should the worst happen. You’ll also want to look out for DDoS protection so that hackers can’t cripple your site.

6. The final choice: Your Domain!
Now that you’ve decided on all the details to get your website up, now you should think about your domain name. Businesses can literally live-and-die by their choice. Choose something too long or too tricky to spell,and you’re doing the equivalent of building an incredible shop down a blind alley where no one will ever find it. Be memorable, keep it relevant, and make sure there are no major competitors with similar names.

PS. Don’t forget the extension!
You may have the best domain name in the world on the tip of your tongue,but it’s no use without the right extension. In an ideal world, you’d secure the .co.uk and the .com so that you have all the bases covered. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Complete the hosting sign up </h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Now that you’ve found a package that meets all of the requirements above, the checkout process is nice and smooth. Simply add your chosen package to your basket like you would any other purchase, enter your contact and payment details, and you’ve just taken the biggest step so far to get things up and running.

Just remember to set your domain to auto-renew. Most hosts will only save your domain for the next 12-months,and you don’t want to find out one day that your domain has been taken down because you forgot to renew it for another year! 
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">It’s Building Time: How to Install WordPress</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

While I’ve already recommended a managed WordPress host so that you automatically receive those all-important security updates and patches I want to take a small step back here. We’re going to cover everything needed to manually install WordPress and get it up and running on your server. That way no matter which way you decide to go you’ll still only need to work your way through my guide until it’s all done in a single afternoon!
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">The Prep: 4 Steps before downloading</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

First things first you’ll need to have FTP access to your server. This will allow you to move files around and upload the content that you want. If you haven’t got it by default, then I suggest contacting your host at the earliest opportunity.
Next, you need something called an FTP client. This is the piece of software that your computer will use to copy and transfer files from your hard drive onto your web server. They’re free and readily available, although you may need a specific Windows or OS X version depending on what you’re running. 
Open your text editor and have it ready and waiting: simple right!
Finally, you need to pick your favorite web browser. You want something which supports HTML5 and CSS3 which unfortunately rules out IE for all you Explorer lovers out there. Chrome and Apple’s Safari are still good though.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">The Install: 5 quick steps so we can start building!</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

1. Head to WordPress.org and download the latest version.
You’ll receive a.ZIP file,and because of how large it is it may take a couple of minutes to download. Once it appears in your downloads folder, you’ll want to double-click it and unzip the contents. 

2. Use your FTP client to load the WordPress files to your server. 
 Most FTP clients look super simple and consist of two columns of file thumbnails. One lists everything on your computer, the other shows everything that’s sitting on your server. Locate all of the WordPress files >>drag the cursor to highlight them>>>then drag and drop all of them into the server’s column. 

3. Make a MySQL database to use with WordPress 
For all you tech lovers out there you’ll be interested to know that WordPress doesn’t statically store any of the content on your pages. Instead, it stores everything in a, readable database that dynamically creates each page whenever a browser asks for it. That means that you need to create a database that is specific to your WordPress site. Here’s what you need to do: 

Open your web hosting control panel
Locate your database module: this is what enables you to create MySQL databases 
Enter a suitable name for your new database 
Click ‘create database.’ 
Create a MySQL user that is permitted to change the database. Make sure password protect everything with something memorable when prompted to
Your new database is now ready to be connected to WordPress! 


4. Configure WordPress so that it connects to your new database  
We’re getting close to having all the machinery in the background up and running, just a few more quick steps for you to follow:

Reopen your trusty FTP client 
WordPress will try and find details of your database in a file that’s called ‘wp-config’ so you’ll want to rename your sample file so that it will find ‘wp-config.php.’
Double-click and open ‘wp-config.php’ in your text editor and enter the details of your database accordingly 
Use the WordPress secret key generator when prompted to >>>add the randomly generated keys to your database credentials. This will add an essential additional layer of security that will prevent unwanted intruders from being able to edit the content you upload to your site
Save and close ‘wp-config.php,’ all the editing is complete.
5. Let’s run the WordPress installation script  
This is a simple one that WordPress will talk you through in a couple of minutes.

Put your site’s address into your browser
Add your site’s title and your admin username when prompted to 
Enter your password and a contact email address
Get ready to build your website now that WordPress is successfully installed!  
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Choosing your theme: standout from the crowd</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">


Choosing a theme will have the single biggest impact on how your site looks. Take a look through these handy hints and tips to ensure you pick the right one: 

WordPress has basic themes installed go to >> Appearance >> Themes, and take a look around.
Choose something clean and crisp, not busy and overly complicated 
Choose colors that are easy on the eye and fit well with your branding
You can always buy a premium theme if you can’t find what you want the first time around.
Pick a font that is easy to read; if you’re struggling with it then everyone will be struggling with it! 
If you want to look good on an iPhone, then you want to ensure you select a mobile responsive theme
Hopefully, this gives you plenty of food for thought so that you can work through the library and find a theme that you think will enable you to standout from the crowd. Now all you have to do is install it. 
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Installing your WordPress theme manually and automatically</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Download your chosen theme to your computer 
Move onto your server using your FTP client so that it resides in wp-content/themes/folder
Once the upload is complete, you should see a folder called wp-content/themes/customizr 
Open your WordPress admin dashboard
Go to Appearance >>> Theme, now you should see your uploaded theme in all its glory
Alternatively, you can do everything thing from within WordPress
This can be done automatically by going to Appearances >>> Themes >>>Add New in your WordPress Dashboard.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Installing a WordPress plugin</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">
 


The great thing about WordPress is how uniform it is. That means that the process of installing a plugin is basically the same as installing a theme:

If not already, Login to the WordPress dashboard.
Beneath Appearance on the left-hand side, you will find Plugins 
Move your cursor over Plugins >>Click Add New
Next, either look through the featured, popular, and recommended Plugins or search for a specific one in the right-hand side search box. 
Once you have found the one >>> checked compatibility >>> click install now, and wait for a moment before clicking activate.
You should be aware that some plugins require configuring. You can find out more about a particular one by once again clicking plugins on the left-hand menu. Followed by selecting view details of the specific plugin. You’re now ready to start creating content and posting

 Here are a few handy hints and tips to get you off to a flying start…

The simple way to say: ‘Hello World’ 
There’s no better post to introduce yourself with than the iconic ‘Hello World.’It’s been used to launch some of the biggest online giants in history so why buck the trend?

Here are a few steps to follow that will see your first post become instantly accessible to people all over the world:



Log into your WordPress dashboard
Select the ‘posts’ tab 
Select ‘add new.’
A template of a blank post will now be displayed
This is where you can get creative and start talking to the world. The window looks very much like an email with a title box in the upper field and a much larger empty field at the bottom that you can use to write the actual post.

 You can add emphasis with bold, underline, or italics just like you can in any word processing program. Take your time to get it right but don’t obsess because WordPress gives you the option to go back in and edit things if you notice a typo after you’ve already posted it.
</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Get Tagging</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

 The powerful thing about WordPress is how people can search right across its platform using tags. It’s important to include them,and a little thought and creativity can drastically improve your outreach and visibility.

 You’ll see options to select a category for your post (self-explanatory), and another to post your tags. Think of your tags as micro-categories that allow visitors to zone in on what they want to read.
</p>
 <h3 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">FinishingTouches</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

You can add a teaser piece in the Excerpt box which is a great way of hooking readers in a couple of lines so that they don’t get overwhelmed with a huge block of text. You can also add your author details to give your article that professional touch as you build your name online. Finally, you’ll have the option to password protect your post, or even make it private if it’s not ready to be seen by the masses. 

Now click ‘publish,’ and you’ve added the first of many fantasticpieces of work to your new site.


 
Congratulations are in order because you’ve done what you never thought possible: taken your website from an idea to a fully working site in a single afternoon.

<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> AI and the Future of the Job Market  </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Desktop\ai.jpg">

All around us, the very same technology that is said to change the world as we know it is being applied everywhere we look. Our phones can answer complex questions using synthesized voice, our computers can recognize how we look and grant access to familiar faces, and our cars can keep themselves in line or even totally take over steering. We’re talking, of course, about artificial intelligence (AI), an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">New Industrial Revolution </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

So far, AI has made our lives easier in a number of different ways, but many experts fear that its impact in the near future might be far from pleasant. According to a report from McKinsey Global Institute, AI is likely to displace anywhere from 400 to 800 million jobs by 2030, which would require as many as 375 million people to find a new job.

Such a massive transformation of the job market is akin to the Industrial Revolution, which was a period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 during which agricultural societies became more industrialized and urban as they embraced new manufacturing processes. If even the tamest predictions about the impact of AI on the job market come true, we will be looking at another industrial revolution, one that could lead hundreds of millions of people around the world unemployed and entire countries in turmoil.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> Job Destroyer </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

In the European Union, 54 percent of jobs are at risk of computerization, according to a Bruegel analysis. In the United States, 47 percent of workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years, revealed a study by Oxford University researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne. Overall, McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 30 percent of the activities carried out today within 60 percent of jobs can be automated.

Among the jobs that are most likely to be displaced by AI are administrative assistants, customer service representatives, accountants, electrical and mechanical technicians, managers of retail, editors, journalists, salespersons, data entry clerks, drivers, financial analysts, telemarketers, radiologists, and other jobs which depend on repetitive tasks.



“The vast majority of respondents to the 2014 Future of the Internet canvassing anticipate that robotics and artificial intelligence will permeate wide segments of daily life by 2025, with huge implications for a range of industries such as healthcare, transport and logistics, customer service, and home maintenance,” states a Pew Research Center study.

“Half of these experts (48%) envision a future in which robots and digital agents have displaced significant numbers of both blue- and white-collar workers—with many expressing concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality, masses of people who are effectively unemployable, and breakdowns in the social order.”
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> Light at the End of the Tunnel </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

While the future of the job market might seem very bleak, many analysts believe that AI will eventually create more jobs than it destroys. A new report by audit firm PwCstates that while AI could displace roughly 7 million jobs, it could also create 7.2 million jobs, resulting in a modest net boost of around 200,000 jobs.

“Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains,” said John Hawksworth, PwC’s chief economist.“Our analysis suggests the same will be true of AI, robots and related technologies, but the distribution of jobs across sectors will shift considerably in the process.”

Global research and advisory firm Gartner agrees with this assessment, and its recent study states that by 2020 AI will automate 1.8 million people out of work, but it will create 2.3 million jobs, resulting in a net gain of 500,000 new jobs.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">  Conclusion </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Regardless of what impact AI will eventually have on the job market, it’s clear that the transition from a job market where humans were in charge to a job market where humans merely assist intelligent machines will be painful. It could bring a turbulent period of high unemployment, which could even force us to re-think the compact of employment and pass new legislation to help humans coexist alongside machines.

<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Henry Ford famously claimed that half of the money that he put into marketing was well spent. The problem was that he didn’t know which half.  As marketing has evolved we’ve realised that if we target very specific groups of people we are able to improve the return on investment that we make. In other words, we make more dollars in sales for each dollar that we spend on marketing.

What is a Segment?
A market segment is a portion of the population who you believe will be keen buyers of your product or service. Normally they will be homogenous. That is they will have a set of common characteristics that make it easy for you to identify and target them.

Here are some examples:

Electricity companies target home owners
Make up companies target young women
Nappy manufacturers target new mothers
Sports car manufacturers target wealthy businessmen and celebrities
Tractor manufacturers target farmers and agricultural businesses
Dentists target people with tooth pain
Tank manufacturers target defence ministries
Advertising agencies target companies who need new customers
Those are almost the simplest segments that you can come up with. A segment that targets “women” isn’t a segment. It’s laziness. “Which women?” is the next question. Most “women” won’t care about your product or service. Some of them will. It’s important therefore to start narrowing down as precisely as you can.

In the examples above you should drill down to ask exactly which sub group is important to you? Which group has the problem that your solution really solves.

Why is Segmentation Important?
Segmentation is important because it means that you spend less money and effort getting customers. Imagine that you have a thousand match sticks. One hundred of them are red. I am going mix them all up in a big heap and then blindfold you. Every time you pick a stick I will charge you $5. Every time you get a red stick I will give you $20.

On average if you pick 10 sticks you will pay me $50 and I will give you $20 in return. You’ll have lost $30. That’s what marketing is like if you don’t segment the market correct. You end up talking to a lot of people who don’t care, and you waste your time and money.


 
Let go back and look at the matchsticks more closely. When we put them under the microscope we discover that a lot of the match sticks have a little pink dot on them. None of those are red. Aha! Let’s take all the pink dot matchsticks out of the pile. We take 700 away. Now when we pick ten matchsticks we still pay $50. On average you’ll have picked 3 red matchsticks and got $60. You’ll have made a profit of $10.

What segmentation does is to give us a set of rules about who is and who is not an ideal customer. In many industries you should be able to look at a crowd of people and point out the people who will buy from you. You should also be able to point out the people who never buy from you. The ones that you are totally sure about are your ideal customers.

In your business it’s no good if you as the CEO are the only one who knows who the ideal customers are. All your staff should know. That way they too can focus their efforts on the people who matter – the people who pay. What we do is we make lists of all the ways that ideal customers are like each other and different to other people.


 
There are lots of ways of creating these lists. Demographics, Psychographics and Jobs to Be Done are three approaches to making a picture of an ideal customer. The simples though is to take photos. These can be photos of real customers, or pictures from the internet or magazines. Having a strong visual image of your perfect customer can transform your marketing and sales.

In this article I covered the basics of customer segmentation. We’ve looked at
<br>

What a segment is
Why it is important, and
What an ideal customer is.
The more you focus on targeting your ideal customer and defining the customer segments that you want to sell to the better the return on investment you will see from your marketing and the more profitable your business will be 
<br>

Customer Demographics
Demographics are one of the key ways of segmenting consumer markets. Demographers look at large populations of people and based on the characteristics of the group, or how it is changing use it to help segment markets. This helps improve the effectiveness of their marketing
<br>

What are Demographics
So, what are demographics? At it’s simplest demographics is the study of information about the people in a country or a geographical location to find useful insights about them. These insights are then used to market and sell goods more effectively.

An example is if we look at the population of a country by age. In this case we will look at Russia.



If we look at this we can see that there are very few teenagers and young adults compared to the rest of the population. This is because the birth rate dropped significantly after the fall of the Soviet Union. However, we can see that the birth-ratehas increased in the last 10 years. Using this information, we may decide to open a children’s clothing store, rather than one focusing on teenagers.


 
Some of the ways that we segment a population using demographics include:

Age
Gender
Race
Ethnicity
Income
Education
Occupation
Family Size
Family Life Cycle
Religion
Social Class
Looking down this list and thinking about your ideal customer what can you say about them under each heading?
<br>

Why are Demographics Important?
Demographics are useful and important because like it or not whilst we are wonderfully unique as individuals en masse we behave in very similar ways. These common behaviours can be used to group us into categories which are then easy to market to.

Let me give an example of how this works. Most young men enjoy risky behaviour and attention seeking. They also enjoy reading about other men doing rock climbing, martial arts and free diving. They read magazines and blogs about them. Marketers then target these 16 – 25-year-old men through the magazines that they read.

If you take an older slice of men you discover that their risky and attention seeking behaviour has declined. This is because they have got married and now need a stable income to feed and house their young family. Their behaviour changes and thus they stop being interested in sky diving and instead learn DIY.
<br>

How to use Demographics
To use demographics effectively the best approach is to take a list like the one I used above. Then for each of your segments write down what you think about each category. The first time you do this it is always a bit vague. That is ok. A single step towards your goal is better than no step.

Do this for every segment that you are targeting and pretty quickly you will have a sketch of your customer segments. One way of using this immediately is to plug it into Facebook advertising. Facebook allows you to target customers based on their demographics (amongst other characteristics). If you have a hypothesis about several segments you can test them against other in a simple experiment and see which performs best.


 
 As you segment with demographics you tend to get increasingly strong insights into your customers. For example, you may think initially that your customers will be 16 – 25. As you test this segmentation you realise that it is 18 – 23-year olds that you need to be targeting. This allows you to increase your focus on what really matters to your customers.

In this article I covered the basics of using customer demographics in a start-up to improve your marketing.
</p>
We looked at:
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">What customer demographics are </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Why customer demographics are important, and
How to use customer demographics to increase improve your marketing and increase your sales.
It is always very clear to be focused in your targeting of the ideal customer. Targeting someone who is never going to buy, or who is expensive to acquire as a customer, is not a good use of your money
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Customer Psychographics </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Customer psychographics is another way of helping you to segment customers into a meaningful group. There are a number of times when demographics don’t help a great deal. A good example is when they don’t allow you to differentiate your offering. For example, consider a developer creating iPhone games. They may have their demographics very accurate, but they are not effective in the marketplace. This is because every competitor is targeting the same demographic. You need to dig deeper and this is called psychographics

Customer Personalities
The first approach to psychographics is to think about customers’ personalities and what they like. The theory behind this is fairly simple. If you know what customers like then it is easier to position your product with the things they like, or in the same frame.

An example of this would be if you are marketing to small children and you investigate their personalities and what they like. You discover that small boys like play fighting, but small girls like playing with dolls. You can then segment the market into boys and girls. In this case you still have sex/gender underlying the segmentation, but the primary aspect of it is liking play fighting or not.

Now let’s imagine that some of these small boys like playing fighting and they like playing with dolls. We’ve now moved away from demographic segmentation to one based on personalities. Hasbro’s Action Man dolls very successfully catered to this segment of the market in the 70’s and 80’s. They sold what were effectively Barbie dolls with green uniforms and guns to a segment that really hated playing with dolls.

Customer Motives
Another approach is to consider customer motives. These are very different to personalities. Why do people want to do something? What do they want to achieve? Often motives are associated with the big goals that people have in their lives. These can be to do with jobs, relationships, shelter and children. A great example is if we look at a segment of people who want to get married.

Their motive is to get married, or fall in love. How can we segment them? As people get older they tend to want to move out of the dating stage of their life and settle down with a single person. As they do so their motivations tend to change. No longer is their behaviour focused on attracting attention from the opposite sex. Instead they they are focused on retaining that attention and deepening the relationship.


 
DeBeers, the diamond company, and Tiffanys, the jeweller, both segment customers by motive by looking at young men who choose to signal that their motives are pure and permanent by buying an expensive and worthless gift for their partner. The diamond jewellery has no function in running a home or partnership, by using money that could have been used for a home, it signals that the man is confident that he can provide for his partner. All this is driven by his motives and his desire for long lasting love and and romance.

Customer Lifestyle
The third approach is to segment by customer lifestyle. Here we look at consumers lives in a more holistic way. Can we describe the commonalities in a large group of people’s lives and see how we can sell something to them based on those similarities? As it happens there are lots of ways of doing that and it is a very effective way of selling to people.

Triathlon is a sport where athletes have to swim, then cycle and then run. The races are difficult because you have to put a lot of time into them to become fit enough, you have to spend more time to achieve technical mastery and you have to buy expensive equipment such as bicycles. Most people find all this pretty challenging and as a result most triathletes tend to identify closely together in the triathlete lifestyle. That is based around lots of training, a healthy diet, and getting up early to do their training.

Thinking about the lifestyle that I’ve described what can you sell to them? Healthy diet and nutrition plans? Scheduling software or time management coaching? Physiotherapist and injury prevention equipment?All these and the sports equipment? You bet! As you understand a customer’s lifestyle you are increasingly able to understand him and identify what he really needs to make it a success.

In this article I’ve talked about three different ways of looking at customer psychographics. These included:

Customer personalities – understanding who they are
Customer motives – understanding what they want
Customer lifestyles  - understanding how they live
</p>
Know these about your customers helps you to design and sell products and services that they really want, and in doing so grow your sales.
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">Jobs To Be Done</h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

In this article I’ll talk about a concept called Jobs to Be Done and how it can help you get deep insights about what your customer wants and design better better products and services. It will also give you understanding of what you need to be talking about when you design your marketing campaigns.

In a nutshell when you think about Jobs to be Done you are going back to the deep underlying problems that customers need to be solved. Understanding these gives you a huge advantage in designing killer products

What are they hiring you to do
The basic idea is this. Look at any product and ask “What am I hiring this to do?”I have a can of Diet Coke in front of my as I write this article in a café. What am I hiring it to do? I’m not really thirsty so I haven’t hired it to quench my thirst. I am quite awake and alert so I’m not hiring it for the caffeine jolt that will wake me up. I am thinking quite deeply and every time I pause to think I take a drag on my coke. Sorry. I take a sip of my coke. As you can tell I am an ex-smoker. That gives us the truth of why I hired the coke. I hire the coke to replace my smoking habit whilst thinking.

That’s pretty weird isn’t it. The original insight here came from when McDonalds was trying to figure out why it sold lots of milkshakes in the morning to people who didn’t buy breakfast. In the afternoon it sold lots of milkshakes, but then the people who bought them nought several instead of just one. Each group was demographically identically but the buying behaviour was quite different.What was happening?


 
In the morning commuters were buying milkshakes on their commute.They could have bought lots of things, including coffee. What they bought was a milkshake because it lasted a long time. The commuters were hiring the milkshake because it made their drive far less boring. In the afternoon they were on the way home and were excited and not bored. The job that they were hiring the milkshake to do was to provide a guilt free way of saying yes to their kids. Same product, same demographic, totally different jobs.

Why is this different
As you can see,“Jobs to Be Done” delves a lot more deeply into the customer’s psyche. In many of these cases the customer was not aware of the reason why they bought the product. Compared to looking at customer demographics or psychographics it’s a lot harder to get information. It’s not available from the census or other survey information. It has to be discovered through talking to the customer.

That might sound like it’s a focus group. It’s not. A focus group is all about understanding what a customer thinks about a subject. When we look at “Jobs to be Done”, we are trying to understand the process that a customer takes on his buying journey. A typical focus group would start talking to customers about the milkshake and the McDonalds purchasing experience.

In contrast when we take a jobs to be done approach we’d start with understanding the customer’s morning routine. Where do they sleep. How do they wake up. How does their morning proceed.Why does the morning have the shape it does. As you understand the process and the rhythm of their life really deep insights start to emerge. Walmart used this process to double the sale of mattresses. It thought customers were impulse shopping for mattresses. What was actually happening was that customers were initiated by the high intensity sales of traditional mattress shops and after thinking about buying a mattress for 6 months and putting it off….they impulse bought exactly what they wanted when they saw it in Walmart.

What insights can you get
The insights that you get from “Jobs to Be Done” are often unique. They aren’t easily accessible to competitors. That means that unlike other sources of information about customers you can use them to develop sources of competitive advantage in your product or service. Essentially you are taking an idea or a concept that your competitors know nothing about and building it into your sales and marketing process. It’s often not immediately apparent to the competitor. They know that you have changed something, but the insight is only really visible to the customer. That’s powerful juju

The difficulty is that you have to have deep conversations with customers to identify these insights. The insights are normally qualitative. Unlike demographic data you can’t say x% of people are like this and therefore will act like this. Instead, jobs to be done data slowly appear out of the interviews and discussions as enlightenment. Depending on the marketing department’s methodology that may not be defensible. “I’ve got a feeling…” doesn’t always win friends.

This makes it appear a great deal more risky than traditional methods of segmenting customers. The reality is that by understanding them more deeply it is far easier to give customers what they want. The risk is in not having numerical data to fit existing mindsets, not in misunderstanding customers requirements. “Jobs to be done” is the most innovative approach to segmenting customers, potentially the most powerful and certainly the least used.

In this article I’ve looked at jobs to be done theory as a third approach to customer segmentation. It relies on deep questioning of customers and understanding why they hire particular products to do the jobs that are important to them. The jobs that products are hired for is not immediately obvious and may differ widely from conventional expectations. “Jobs to be done” theory is an innovative approach to customer segmentation.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> Value Propositions</h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

A value proposition is the promise that you make to your customer. ‘I promise you that this is what I will deliver when you buy from me’. Proposition is another word for promise or offer. When we talk about value propositions what we are really talking about is a collection of products features and benefits that solve the customer’s problem.

Some are fairly straight forward, but the companies that are often the most successful develop innovative offers that meet customer requirements in ways that delight and astound them. It is this innovation that constantly raises the bar for competitors.

Features and benefits
One of the biggest mistakes that I see entrepreneurs making is focusing on product features.  A feature is a description of what the product is. A benefit is a description of how the product is useful to the customer. Which do you think is more useful to the customer?

One of my cars is described as having a ‘common rail diesel’.  That is a feature. It totally mystifies me. I really don’t care about what the engine size is, what type of engine it has or the number of cylinders. What I care about is whether it is going to get me up the 30km dirt road to my friends’ cottage deep in the jungle. Can you see the features and benefits? Features describe the car and leave the customer dying to jump the gap between them ad the benefit that they really want.

So when you start designing your product it is important to be clear what the benefits are. Will it help the customer look more beautiful, make more deals, be happier or weigh less? Those are benefits. The more beneficial your product seems in relation to other products then the better it will sell. Features are important though. When you have similar products the customer will want to compare them. The customer will often use features to do direct comparison because they are more precise and concrete than benefits.

Gains and gain creators
When we do value proposition design what we do is start looking at the gains that a customer wants to achieve. This afternoon I came into Starbucks to write this article.  What gains was I looking for? I wanted somewhere with WiFi (so I could post the article on the blog), A comfy chair (so that I could focus on writing) and a peaceful environment (so I could get work done). The hot chocolate that I bought was really a cost that I paid to get access to the first three gains.

Starbucks understands that there are lots of customers like me. One of its customer segments is a group of people who need somewhere to work in relative peace and quiet for a few hours. So it designs its value proposition to deliver that. It does that be identifying things that create gains.

In this case it provides WiFi so I keep sitting here and working (and spending money on lattes). It also provides a range of different types of seat. From where I sit I can see five different styles of seat each of which fits a slightly different set of needs. It also has high prices – to keep noisy school kids out (unlike McDonalds) and classical music that makes people feel that it is a tranquil working environment.  These gain creators help create a service where the customer can achieve his goals.

Pains and pain killers
There is another side of the picture though. As a customer I have a variety of pains that I am trying to overcome. These are things that irritate or discomfort me as I try to achieve my goals. Just as you need to look at what a customer wants to gain and find gain creators you also need to look at the customer pains and build pain killers into the value proposition.

One of my pains is that as I am working in my iPad I need to charge it. Another is that after drinking lots of cups of coffee I want to be able go to a nice clean toilet. A final one is that as it is very hot outside (I’m in the tropical Philippines) I don’t want to stay sweltering in my sweat. These are three fairly typical pains that I have when I am away from home and needing to do some work.

Starbucks solves the first by providing a variety of charging sockets. At least they usually do. In this Starbucks I can’t find anywhere to charge and so my pain is still there. That’s a big fail on the value proposition as it means I can only work here for a limited time. The toilets are handy and clean, and the baristas even keep an eye on my Bagus I use them. Finally the air con is delish and it makes me hesitate to venture outside again. Maybe I will have another hot chocolate.

In this article I’ve looked at three different aspects of your value proposition. Features and benefits are what customers often see in your marketing material. As you develop that you need to consider what the customer’s pains and gains are. Your success then comes from being able to effectively solve those pains and give him the gains that he craves. The better the value proposition the more remarkable your business is.

<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> How Virtual and Augmented Reality Can Aid Smart Learning  </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

<img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\Desktop\argu.jpg">

Smart learning involves making good use of advanced technologies to enhance and enable an easy, enjoyable learning experience. In this digital era, virtual and augmented reality has a great role to play in aiding smart learning. Even modern learners are beginning to appreciate this role.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">  Breaking the Terms </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Now, what exactly do we mean by virtual and augmented reality?Virtual reality involves the recreation of an experience through the use of software and specialised devices (VR Gears and 360 Gears). Augmented reality, on the other hand, involves the combination of digital information with their own environment. So what is the difference between virtual and augmented reality within the learning space? Virtual recreates, while augmented simply makes use of the existing surroundings.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">  So how can virtual and augmented reality aid smart learning? </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

A More Exciting and Engaging Learning Process
This is a major benefit of virtual and augmented reality. There is an assurance that learners get, as they see that they can actually implement what they have been taught without any form of repercussion. Virtual and augmented helps learners to gain deep understanding of what they are being taught as they are easily stirred to ask questions. They eventually become active participants in the learning experience as they are easily captured by what they see. What virtual and augmented reality has to offer is freedom from the conventional, boring learning methodto a more exciting and engaging learning experience that encourages learners’ participation and sustain their interest in learning.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> Creating Challenging or Seemingly Impossible Scenarios  </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

With virtual and augmented reality, certain scenarios can now be created, which would have beenchallenging or seemingly impossible in the real world. For instance, instead of taking the group of learners to different work sites to experience how things are done, technology now allows the learners to experience this in a single environment. Aside from saving cost, stress, energy and time, it increases safety and allows learners to have a more practical-learning experiences.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;"> Easy Self-Guided Exploration  </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

Since virtual and augmented reality allows one to create an environment that is safe and gives room for different experiments that might have been too expensive or risky, it is easier for learners to easily learn from mistakes, correct the mistakes and try out experiments again until the desired result is achieved. This way, a lot of real life errors will be avoided and this will pave way for more efficiency in different fields.
</p>
<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:sans-serif; color:yellow;">  The Future of Smart Learning </h1>
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:cursive; color:blue;">

The future of smart learning is bright, especially with the use of virtual and augmented reality.There is the promise of an exciting and engaging learning experience, and more practical-learning experiences that save cost, time, stress and energy.

It is clear that virtual and augmented reality is here to stay and will be highly productive in the learning environment.Learners will become more involved in the learning process and this will ensure more successful learning. Therefore, virtual and augmented reality should become a crucial component of every learning environment as it can aid smart learning to a great extent.
