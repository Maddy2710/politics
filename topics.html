<p style="font-size:130%; font:cursive; color:white;">

<br>Challenges are a part of life.Sometimes we let them get the better of us,and find ourselves succumbing to them.However,there is always hope to bring light into the dark spells that come our way.We just have to know where to look for it.</br>

<br>We may have illnesses, financial or relationship problems, or even loss of reputation. We may experience some dark patches. But we do not have to be blinded by the darkness. The following anecdote has an instructive message to help us through the dark spells.There was once a cave that lived underground, as most caves do. Since it spent its entire life in darkness, it had never seen any light. One day, a voice talked to the cave, and said,Come up into the light. Come and enjoy the sunlight.I do not know what you mean by light. All I have ever known is darkness, the cave replied. Come and see for yourself, said the voice.The cave mustered up enough courage and climbed slowly up from the depths of the earth. Suddenly, it reached the top of the earth and was surrounded by magnificent light, the likes of which the cave had never seen in its life.This is beautiful, said the cave.After enjoying the light for a while, the cave said to the sunlight, Now it is your turn to come with me and see the darkness.What is darkness? asked the sunlight. The cave answered, Come and see for yourself. The sunlight decided to visit the caveas home. As the sunlight entered the cave, it said,Now show me your darkness.But with the sunlight there, there was no darkness to be found.</br>

<br>What this anecdote illustrates is the power of light. Wherever there is light, there can be no darkness. Whenever we feel we are in a dark spell of our life, we need only tap into the Light of our soul. We are Light. Our soul is Light. Our true nature is Light. If we would only identify with our true nature, we would find there is no darkness. If we would also bring our own innate goodness and Light into our daily life, we would never be overcome by the darkness of life again.

Each one of us has the Light of the soul within us. But we are not aware of it because we identify ourselves with the outer world of darkness and illusion. If we would invert our attention within through meditation, we would discover this illuminating Light.

Whenever we find we are faced with sickness, financial problems, ignominy, or loss, we can remember that these are but passing clouds in the brilliant sunlit sky. Our true reality is Light and love. When we associate with the temporary illusions of this world, we feel pain. But when we realise that outer events are but a dream existence, a passing show that is but temporary, we can rise above the pain and disappointment.

When we find sadness or misfortune, let us count the numerous times we have experienced happiness and good fortune. When we fail, let us learn from our mistakes and try again. When we find ourselves in darkness, let us close our eyes and focus within until we see the Light. That Light will bring with it peace, joy, and love.</br><hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:250%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"><b>PURITY OF MIND,INTELLECT & SOUL</b></h1>
<img src="https://cdn.mindful.org/how-to-meditate.jpg?q=80&fm=jpg&fit=crop&w=1920&h=1080">
<p style="font-size:130%; font-family:sans-serif; color:white;">
<br>Pure mind, intellect and soul tend to converge, said Ramakrishna. Pure mind entertains pure thoughts and the rest is overlooked but not suppressed because suppression raises the probability of reappearance. It encourages and guides to pursue action for the well-being of society. Desire and greed-based action may add to the accumulated stock of luxury but it binds the mind to the possession one has. Hence, the sense of freedom or what Sankhya calls"jivanmukti" state of mind can never be attained.</br>

<br>The domestic will never open the door to the universal  experiencing the vastness within oneself would remain unrealised. On the other hand, selfless action holds the key to the ultimate purpose of life. Selfless action cannot be pursued without a pure mind. To initiate selfless action one does not have to wait for purity to arrive with pomp and show. While pursuing action, if one is conscious of the aspect of selflessness, automatically, purity of mind will grow. Only from field experience purification begins, it can never happen in a closed-door situation.</br>



<br>Pure intellect can guide the mind and help avoid unnecessary interferences and observations. One can avoid petty matters by following the process of identifying what is beneficial for the larger good. Mere intellect, can put one into manipulative action.  So it will have to be associated by purity without which it will not be in a position to guide the mind to rise beyond self-promoting acts.

Purity of soul is divinity personified. Purity of mind and intellect helps attain purity of soul. Not everyone may be born with pure divinity. But with the help of purity of mind and intellect one is capable of attaining divinity. We are born as human but we may leave the earth as divine.

In an individualistic society we are concerned about our own freedom and we hesitate to intervene in other areas as that may conflict with someone else domain of freedom. But the concept of social work is important. Without hurting the sentiments of others how the principle of giving can actually benefit others without nurturing our ego is an important consideration. Righteous action requires a great deal of self-discipline and at the same time it runs a high risk of facing harassments. But mental courage may help us pursue our efforts. By sharing we only gain but that sharing must not sound like a donation. It has to be followed more as a service.</br>

<br>The other vehicle is meditation. Through constant prayers we understand, that the entire universe is manifestation of divinity. Meditation inculcates love in oneheart based on which one then realises that everyone is his own image, a vast ocean of divinity. With this realisation discriminatory feeling towards others naturally disappears.

The lack of shared prosperity begets tension. On the other hand, inclusion of spiritual dimension in our economic pursuits expands the horizon of development in all possible ways. If we believe in negative externalities it is not difficult to see that hatred can threaten the future prospects of growth and benefits associated with it. On the other hand, if the basic institutions of spiritual development can be combined with economic pursuits, then complementary effects can be reaped on a large scale.</br><hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;">No exit from the compulsion of choice</h1>
<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GFvSq-SJN0M/VbQQ4UwAFhI/AAAAAAAABoM/TIZ-yKdEDdA/s1600/Choices.jpg">
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:sans-serif; color:white;">
In Sartres play ˜No Exit, Henri, a member of the Maquis  the underground resistance group, which fought against the Nazis in German-occupied France during World War II â€“ is taken prisoner and brought to the local Gestapo headquarters to be interrogated.

Henri knows himself to be a physical coward who will not be able to withstand the torture he will be subjected to by the Gestapo to obtain information about the Maquis.

When he is asked by his inquisitors, as to where the next Maqui attack will take place, to mislead the Nazis, Henri gives them false information by naming the wrong place.

However, he knows that when the Germans realise theyve been misdirected they'll return and he will be tortured to give up the right information.

In order not to betray his comrades-in-arms, Henri tries to get out of his dilemma by the only way he can: he jumps out of an open window and falls to his death on the prison courtyard, three floors below.



Henri never realises that the sacrifice of his life has been in vain. Knowing Henris weakness, and fearing that if captured and tortured he would eventually succumb and give his captors the knowledge they sought, the members of his group had deliberately fed him misinformation about their operations.

So when Henri, in his desperation, gives the Gestapo what he believes is wrong information, in a cruel irony he unwittingly betrays his comrades by directing the Germans to where the raid has actually been planned, resulting in the entire group being gunned down by the Nazis.

Sartres play dramatically sums up the crux of his existentialist philosophy: We are always, and inevitably, free to choose our actions, what we will or will not do, but we cannot choose, or have any control over, what the outcome of our choice will be. Henri was free to choose between betraying his comrades and ending his own life, and chose the latter.

But his self-sacrifice was of no avail for he unknowingly did betray his comrades and cause their deaths. Can Henri be held morally responsible for this?

This is the core dilemma of all existence. All of us, in our day-to-day lives, have to make choices  what career to pursue, whom to choose as life partner, what faith, if any, to follow, whom to vote for in an election  without having any knowledge of what the end result of our choice will be.

We cant opt out of making choices by saying â€˜Que sera, sera, what will be will be, and leave everything in the hands of destiny, fate, or some deity. For such a decision, of choosing not to choose, is also a choice, and will lead to consequences we cannot foresee or foretell.

Are we, like Sartres Henri, responsible for the end results of the choices that we have no choice but to make?

We can say that we can be held responsible only for that which we do knowingly; we cannot be held responsible for the unforeseen, and unforeseeable, repercussions of our choices.

Fair enough. But making a choice, any choice, is a conscious act, which must include some conjecture as to what effect that choice may have on us, and on others. To that extent, we cannot disown, or disassociate ourselves, from the choices we make, because these choices define our existence; they define who we are.

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Something you may never ever dream of  </h1>
<img src="https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/13317554_f520.jpg">
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:sans-Serif; color:white;">

I first saw a calculator at the age of thirteen. I was deeply offended, wondering why on earth we were being tortured in math class when all that the teacher needed to do was to consult a machine for the answer! I dreamt of the day when there would be a machine for every other class as well.



There is a pervasive notion that spiritual life is antagonistic to the mind. This is a fallacy. The human mind is responsible for the great advances of culture and civilisation. But we have accorded disproportionate importance to a single aspect of the mind: the intellect. Today, it is those with great memories who are considered intelligent. They pass examinations with ease, get top grades, bag PhDs and are hailed as thinkers of repute. This is, primarily, because they remember what they study and are efficient at reproducing the same.

Traditionally, in the Indian subcontinent, wisdom was always prized over knowledge. Human memory was certainly valued, and those who could recite the Vedas were respected as scholars. However, human thought was never accorded ultimate importance, because it was seen as the product of memory. Instead, what was of inherent value was a more profound intelligence called ‘chitta’ – the deepest dimension of the human mind, the capacity to perceive existence as it is, rather than as we think it is. This is why the guru was always considered far more significant than the scholar.

Education, parentage and pedigree were socially significant, but never existentially significant. It was only if you touched this dimension of unsullied intelligence – the living mind of the cosmos – that you were considered enlightened. Until then, you could be seen as a scholar who knew a great deal about creation. But until you touched the very source of creation, you were not regarded as self-realised.

In the near future, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will radically change the way we look at intelligence. Our ideas of education will be fundamentally altered. Moving from the ways of creation to the ways of the source of creation – this is the way of the future. If you are looking for tools of self-transformation, a memory-based educational system will be of no use. The intellect, which is based on memory, is a wonderful tool. However, it can only inform; it cannot transform.

In the AI Age, only those capable of exercising intelligence beyond memory will have something truly valuable to contribute. The fundamental difference between a human being and machine is perception. The machine will be capable of data accumulation, analysis and action – all of which are functions of the intellect – but little else.

The human mind is an organic machine, but a machine, nonetheless. If we are to distinguish ourselves from machines in any meaningful way, and not merely replicate their functions, we need to empower our capacity to perceive. For this we need to reclaim our access to that unfettered, unprejudiced intelligence that is the basis of our lives.

I never bless people with the wish that their dreams should come true. Since dreams are simply based on memory, you can only dream of a more magnified and more improved version of what you already know! What is so special about your dreams coming true? My wish is that your dreams should be shattered. Only then will something larger than memory will manifest in your life. May something you can never dream of happen to you.<hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Stop inner contradiction and conflict  </h1>
<img src="https://gcjzd2fnxi-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Stop-Sign-S.T.O.P.-768x768.jpg">
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:sans-serif; color:white;">

No man is fully accomplished until he has acquired the ability to attend to his life in the deepest sense. Most of the time, our attention is on external accomplishments, such as name, fame and position, is it not?

Are we attentive to our hurts, anxieties, inner contradictions and jealousies, which erode the quality of life? They are viruses destroying us. We need to attend to this disorder. This is part of our ignorance; our inner foolishness.

We need to observe inner contradictions. Since we don’t observe this, there is lack of peace in us. We go on asserting or denying what we want and what we are. This creates inner conflict and conflict leads to pain.

What do you mean by conflict? Why do you think there is a contradiction? When there is contradiction and conflict, there must be a struggle, and in that state we create nothing but antagonism, friction and bitterness. This is a kind of inner hostility. If we free ourselves from this, there is inner peace.



There is a contradiction to ‘what is’ and ‘what one wants to become’. This is the basic conflict in which friction exists. “But is this not but natural?” one may ask. By branding it as natural, one stops exploring, and thus suffers.

Are we seeing ‘what is’ in the truest sense? One is busy in getting what one wants and has thus stopped truly seeing ‘what is’. There is a hurry to get what one wants rather than rejoice what one has or see what one has. Hence, one does not maximise on what one has in one’s life.

Learn to observe your breath. When you observe your inhalation and exhalation, you will see breathing is joy. Without which, you are dead. Mind has become so gross in ‘becoming’ that you miss seeing the ‘being’. When you observe just breathing, you will experience joy and then your heart will fully breathe. Just this breathing becomes a point of celebration.

But we have taken this breathing for granted, and hence we are lost in getting some object of illusion and hoping it will give joy.

When you attentively eat, then eating becomes meditation. When you put your whole awareness in eating, then in just eating an apple you will see that apple is an ambassador from the cosmos, from the whole. The apple is a result of the tree, and in it exists sunlight, water, air and earth. The whole is in the apple. With this awareness, when you eat, you are in communion with the apple and hence with the whole. A different life opens up in such a living.

Then, life is a movement of joy from one point to another point. It is not ‘becoming’ but a movement of ‘being or presence’. Then there is no conflict. Getting your goals is not a conflict or contradiction but a journey of joy. Only here conflict ends, and in that space there are no inner contradictions. But for this, there is a conflict of the ‘now’ when you do not get what you want and the conflict manifests in the form of hurt, upset, sorrow. This is because you imagine getting what you want is joy. This conflict adds to the chaos.<hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Why listening is more than an art  </h1>
<img src="https://dailyasianage.com/library/1552243126_4.jpg">
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:sans-serif; color:white;">

Listening is more than an art. It is something written in our genes. If we could not listen, we would not have been able to respond to the world around us. From the early morning call of the birds and the hum of bees, to the sound of horns and passing traffic, we are daily taking in sounds that surround us. Yet, we are not fully conscious of these sounds; they remain in the background of our minds.

So it is with conversations. As we grow up and develop personalities of our own, we tend to talk more than we listen. We want to be listened to, but will not make the effort to listen to others. That is why there is so much miscommunication in the world.

We can learn from those who exercise the power of listening. When others listen to us, they make us feel secure, validated and understood. They accept us the way we are. They make us feel loved and appreciated. I owe much to people who listened to me, really listened. I may have been advised, may have seen a clearer path after being guided, I may have found out and learned some hidden truths about myself. But more than all those benefits, the very act of deep listening by others, has affirmed me in all i did and said.



Often, we pre-programme our replies, because we have not paused to really listen to the other. Sometimes, we have two or more people who are really shouting out their inner convictions and pre-judged opinions and conclusions at each other, as happens on TV debates. On the other hand, there are good programmes in which the anchor draws out the other by taking time to listen to what they really say.

When listening is face-to-face, it is important to not only listen to the conversation others are making with us, but also to listen to all the non-verbal communication of others. Sometimes, the facial expressions and body language of the other may contradict what the person is saying. In a telephone conversation, we could pick up not only from the tone of voice of the other or the volume with which they speak, but also sense whether the conversation is laced with care, concern and openness or whether it is laced with hostility or indifference.

The American psychiatrist Karl A Menninger called listening “a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force”. He said, “The friends who listen to us are the ones we move towards. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand.”

When we listen to others, we show them respect. When students really listen to their teachers, they are not only showing due respect to them for their knowledge and skills, but also respecting them as persons.

Listening also has a healing quality to it. Illness and trauma can be cured when others listen to our stories. The priest and author, Henri Nouwen said, “Somewhere we know that without silence, words lose their meaning; that without listening, speaking no longer heals; that without distance, closeness cannot cure.”

The ability to listen is an essential part of our beings. We can become trained listeners. That is an art we can cultivate. More than what we say during the course of a day, what we listen to is from where our learning begins.<hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> What leads you towards excellence?  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">

There is a saying, “Nothing succeeds like success; and nothing fails like failure.” We appreciate the end results, but never look at the efforts. It points to a business-like approach. But life is much more than business. Two students joined a laboratory to do research. One pursued a stereotype approach, followed a well-known path and got some results, published them and left the laboratory with a certificate. The other tried to do something new, but at the end of five years, finished only half of what he was meant to do. He did not get a certificate, because there was no appreciation for his unconventional efforts. The attempt to innovate was nipped in the bud.

A company asked a scientist to develop a solar cell. He developed one, but the efficiency of the solar cell was half of the efficiency of the solar cell available in the market, and the manufacturing cost was double. The scientist was fired.



Both examples suggest that we are not ready to pay a price for innovation. In both cases, there was no lack of sincerity and effort. We do not have patience to develop on our own. We borrow and buy the by-products of others and enjoy them. When we passed out from the school, our headmaster gave a piece of advice. He said, “Dear boys! While growing up, try to depend less and less on others and more and more on yourselves. That would help you develop confidence and lead you towards excellence.”

Today we are lamenting the lack of excellence everywhere; in our educational institutions, in our science, technology and in our manufacturing and services. Ideas are borrowed. Implementation processes are borrowed. Technology is borrowed. Therefore there is no excellence. When we have nothing to show in the present, we go back to the past and claim that our past was better than others. How long will we bask in past glory which has now only limited or no relevance?

Not long ago we did produce a few Nobel laureates, great thinkers and reformers, leaders and doers. It happened because we yearned for change and to achieve it, we were committed and prepared to undertake sacrifices in order to prove our potential and excel.

The spirit of sacrifice gradually faded after Independence. The need of the hour is to excite the youth, encourage them to follow the path less travelled, to overcome the hurdles of destiny, and to shift the target forward so that they can learn to walk ahead fearlessly. Uncertainty could be converted into certainty and hurdles into opportunities.

Only a robust general educational system, can help us achieve this. Positive change will come only when the means of change is based on truthfulness and honesty. MK Gandhi brought about a change in us because he adhered to these principles under all circumstances.

Growth must be universal, not local. In science we have seen that universal laws are more effective than the local ones which are subject to fluctuations. There are many scientists but only a few are remembered, like Newton, Einstein and Darwin because they showed us the eternity of science and the beauty of its creations.

Science is not destructive, it is our inability to use it for constructive, peaceful purposes that proves to be dangerous.<hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Think about it: What makes a good life?  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">

A great career, financial success, a nice family, loads of friends, an active social life and exciting holidays make a good life, right? Think again. Often, i have admired the cheerfulness and tranquillity of many of the security guards, cleaners and gardeners at our building. They arrive at work earlier than required, are always very willing to help and they do it with a smile. I have chatted with a couple of them at times and found their approach to life a reminder of what makes a good life.

Firstly, true quality of life is a reflection not of our standard of living but how we experience life within. Secondly, it is a measure of our level of freedom from our volatile emotional-mental states; how well we win over our frequent feelings of anxiety, fear and envy or craving for a different life. I have noticed three principles that contribute to such a good life.



1. Morality: We cannot be at peace or experience emotional freedom without a clear conscience. A high sense of moral integrity is important for a healthy inner life. Without strength of character, we can easily compromise on ‘minor’ infractions on integrity. We tell white lies, choose convenience over righteousness and assume that the end somehow justifies the means. It doesn’t!

The emotional residue of any wrongdoing stays and accumulates in our psyche and manifests itself in one negative emotion or other. For example, guilt results in anxiety, irritability and low self-esteem. Immoral conduct in business or personal life corrupts and weakens us. Choosing to do the right thing strengthens our inner being.

2. Inner compass: To experience emotional freedom, it’s important to live life on our own terms. We feel free when we align our life to our innate traits, core values and our life’s calling. We carry enormous emotional baggage when we are trying to live a life that we believe others expect us to.

One of the biggest reasons for stress in our lives is our constant propensity to compare ourselves with others. Living by our inner compass relies on feeling grateful for and at peace with who we are and our circumstances. We don’t crave for a different life and choose not to compare ourselves, our life or our progress, with others.

3. Wisdom around control: One of the factors contributing to our inner suffering is our desire to control outcomes – from advancement at work and children’s future to longevity and others’ perception of us. Being focussed on goals and doing our best to reach them is healthy. However, with our high achievement-orientation, we routinely obsess about the outcomes. That significantly increases our emotional burden.

Wise people know the delicate balance between willpower and letting go. They do their best on what’s in their control and are wise enough to let go of the temptation to worry about what’s not in their control. That’s what can help us overcome our constant yearning for favourable outcomes and fully enjoy the present. It also helps us be compassionate towards ourselves, our colleagues and loved ones.

As you may notice, these principles, while not necessarily easy to live by, are great social equalisers. They are within the reach of almost anyone, irrespective of their financial or social status. That’s how some of the staff in my building are happy and peaceful and lead a good inner life. I guess, you and i can, too!<hr></hr>

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Essential principles to enhance your potential </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">

With our sense organs, we understand and experience the world. With meditation, we understand and experience the Self. It is commonly believed that to understand the world is far more important than to understand oneself. This is in spite of the fact that this is the age of self-help books.

Meditation is by far the best self-help tool. Spending a little time to know the Self, will go a long way in bringing success in all fields.

The first principle is to understand: Who are we? Ramana Maharshi encouraged meditation on this question: Who am I?  The first chapter of the Acharanga Sutra dwells on this question and associated ones like, where we come from, where we go from here, and so on. Meditating on such questions will give us a larger perspective of life.

The second principle of self-management is to hold a mirror to oneself. Why do i decide thus? What makes me change my decision? We will soon find that we decide on the basis of the beliefs and opinions that we hold. We think that some things are bad and some others good, and we choose accordingly. This is based on the opinions we hold. We have to assess our beliefs and opinions. Are they well founded? Are they objective? This analysis will help to centre us.



The third principle of self-management is not to understand oneself on the basis of other people’s opinions and views. Praise may boost one’s ego and give a false sense of superiority. Criticism can give one an inferiority complex. Do not regard yourself as either inferior or superior. Get to know yourself by yourself, not through the eyes of others.

An important principle of self-management is developing one’s competence. One has to learn to make a realistic analysis of one’s strength and weaknesses. It is important to always keep improving one’s capabilities. All ambitions should be adequately supported by competence, only then it has meaning. On the basis of your strengths and weaknesses, develop your competence, will power, imagination, cognition, memory and insight. One should develop one’s imagination, but not abuse it. Choose the right time for the right work. All this is improved with Preksha dhyana (meditation).

Contrary to the idea of multitasking, the Thanam Sutra, another Jain text, says, let the mind concentrate on only one thing at a time. The skill to plan and manage things in this manner is best acquired through meditation. Practice only one thing at a time, but give it your hundred per cent.

Weak memory is a setback. The reason lies in obstructions to remembering things, which weaken and impair our memory. In this area too, meditation helps. And focussing on one thing at a time also helps a great deal.

Finally, a life based on needs and not wants can optimise one’s energy in the right direction. Acquiring wealth is essential. So are food, water, clothing and shelter. But along with these, proper ordering of one’s needs is also essential. We mistake all our needs as necessities. What is the criterion for defining our necessities? A little reflection will limit our needs reasonably.

Finally, the clinching aspect is to build good communication skills so that one reaches out to the other with charm. This is the defining skill of living.

<div id="work">
<blockquote>
<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Work and not expectation, produces results  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">


The only thing we all seek is happiness. But, we indulge in contrary actions: one gets married because one wants to be happy; one seeks divorce because one wants to be happy! Is permanent happiness really possible? ‘Yes’, says Sri Krishna, and gives wonderful tips for happiness, success, satisfaction and self-discovery in the Bhagwad Gita.

His first message is, ‘Refuse to be miserable’. Life can be painful, but it need not be sorrowful. If you want to be happy, find occasions to be cheerful. Before you fall into self-pity and blame games, remember that responsibility comes to only those who feel responsible. Challenges are faced by the strong and courageous, and if life brings you such opportunities, then turn failures into success. This is the art of right contact in life.

Hence, develop the right perspective. If we choose to see situations as problems, we will be bogged down. If we choose to see them as opportunities, we will be inspired. Take them as occasions to make a difference, to make a change, and develop inner strength.



Second, pay full attention to the action at hand. Mostly, our mind is busy focussing on results. They do not come according to our whims and fancies. They emerge from the quality of our action in the present. There is a widespread misunderstanding that Krishna directs us to work, without expecting results. Actually, Krishna advises us to concentrate our energy and attention on the work at hand. Even if the outcome of your actions is unfavourable, at least you would have enjoyed the journey.

Therefore, plan out the result and work with a sense of expectation; it inspires you to work, but recognise that the work itself will produce the result, not the expectation. So, expect if you need to, but do not be disappointed. Calmly accept the result and learn from it. If expectation drives you to action, acceptance keeps you working till the end. Apply this to every situation in life. Once you decide to accept the result, not only will you be mindful in your work, you will continue to expect as well as accept. Thereby, you will enjoy both the process and the result. Hence, do your best, leave the rest and accept whatever comes. This is the right attitude, born of right knowledge.

Another beautiful message is: ‘Happiness in life does not depend upon things, but on the people you love and are loved by.’ Therefore, love and be loved. Teamwork is possible, solidarity in the family unit is achievable, harmony in society is possible – only if there is mutual sharing. Share whatever you have in abundance. If you have talent, knowledge, wealth, or even a charming smile, share it freely.

Always remember that values are more valuable than valuables. Whom do we like in this world? Become whatever we admire in others. If we want people to be kind to us, be kind; if we want happiness, give happiness to others. One who brings values into his life, becomes valuable. We should never compromise on our values, irrespective of the behaviour of people around us. The greatest value we respect in others, is humility. The greatest spiritual knowledge is gained by only those who are humble.

Apply these tips in your daily life. Live the Gita and gain permanent happiness – here and now! (The writer is global head, Chinmaya Mission)

<blockquote>
<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;">Gaining strength with intuitive practices   </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">


People cannot propagate a great ideology by their knowledge, intellect or social status alone. They can effectively do it through their conduct. Human conduct gets purified by intuitional practices. You don’t have to come from an exalted family, or have university degrees. Rather, these factors may create false vanity in one’s mind, which may ultimately stand in the way of reforming one’s conduct.

In the universe, two forces are working side by side – the sentient and the static. And one or the other dominates at different times. There is no scope for a pact between these forces. People will have to march ahead amidst the ceaseless struggle of these opposing forces. In society, we see antisocial elements, and also feel a sense of frustration among the moralists. These moralists have therefore developed a tendency to go out of society. With more wealth and strength, antisocial elements are in an advantageous position, and the moralists appear to be the culprits. This state of affairs is not desirable and it should not continue.



Your duty will be to unite the moralists. Let there be two camps. Let there be an open fight. The moralists have been scattered for so long that they could not fight. The united strength of five moralists is much more than the united strength of a hundred immoralists because there is an unholy alliance amongst the latter. Meditation behind closed doors will not do. Gather strength by intuitional practices and unite yourselves against the immoralists.

So your duty is threefold. Your first duty is to observe morality and to do intuitional practices. Without this you cannot have mental determination. Your next duty is to unite the moralists; otherwise, dharma will not endure. The exploited people who do not observe yama and niyama – the cardinal moral principles – cannot fight against their own sense of frustration. It is therefore necessary to unite the moralists. This will be your real dharma. At the third stage, you will have to mercilessly fight against sin wherever it has taken root in this world.

No political party or so-called religious institution can bring salvation. Praising God in concerts with drums and cymbals will not bring salvation either, because this will not bring the sinner to submission.

Shiva’s companions … were virtuous people who were always ready to fight against sin … In the present world you are Shiva’s retinue or “gana”. That is, you have come to the world for victory and not for defeat.

It is not possible to fight against sin if there is some weakness in your mind. In this fight, your goal is not the sin or sinner, your goal is the Supreme Consciousness. Anything that comes in the way of this has to be overcome forthwith. When clouds collect around the pole-star and cover it, your duty will be to remove the clouds and follow the pole-star without caring to see where the clouds have gone. If you always think of your enemy, your mind will adopt the bad qualities of your object of ideation, but if the Supreme Being is your goal, your mind will be metamorphosed into the Supreme Being itself.

You need to serve humanity. You have to dedicate yourself to the cause of humanity as a whole. Your life is valuable; your time is valuable. You should not waste a single moment. Constantly endeavour to overcome negative forces and you will emerge triumphant.

<blockquote>
<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Life flows on, in the river of time  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">


Time can be experienced indirectly in changes, brought about through its relationship with human beings and everything else, be it inanimate or animate; visible or invisible; static or in motion. So, time is present, but time in past and future exists in memories. St Augustine said, “What then, is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.” Yes, the nature of time is indeed perplexing.

Jainism considers that the universe comprises six dravya, eternal substances. These are: soul, sentient beings; matter, non-sentient; dharma, medium of motion, adharma, medium of rest; aakash, space; and kala, time. Time is an essential part of existence, and since soul, consciousness, has awareness of time, it exists in the dimension of time. Body, as matter, is three-dimensional and lives in space which has length, breadth and height. The body gains life by having soul, which exists in the fourth dimension called time. Thus, life becomes four-dimensional, causing the occurrence of different phases of it.

Zen master, Dogen Zenji, relates time with space. Zen teacher, Dainin Katagiri, explains that time can be correctly understood if we realise that all life is interconnected.  If you ignore this aspect of human life, you can’t live in peace and harmony. So, you have to understand that time is not separate from space or being; time is exactly space.



Different phases of day and night (Time) sound exactly the same as the cycles of life of every being. Life from birth to death is analogous to the day, from dawn to night. These phases in Hinduism represent four ashrams – student, householder, retired, and renunciation.

Birth of the child is like dawn – first appearance of the Sun. A child with the passage of time attains adolescence, and then becomes youth, which is like day rising known as noon – zenith of life. After every peak we are bound, just to get below the horizon. Likewise, the journey of life too starts slowing down and gets to the twilight of life, like dusk comes, end of day.

So, as per Hinduism, from sunset to night is the time one must lead a sanyasin’s life and learn and get prepared to say goodbye gracefully, so a night again can turn into another dawn.

We can comprehend time easily if we consider it as a flowing river, and all activities happening in the river represent changes in life. The river as a baby originates perhaps from the womb of mountains and on reaching valleys and plains, it widens and flows quickly, full of vigour and vitality, like a youth. Then gradually moves and falls to ocean – its destination. During its journey, it experiences lots of ups and downs, changes, barriers, challenges, sudden turns, curves, good or bad seasons, but keeps flowing to ultimately reach its destination, without stopping. Inside the stream we get affected by changes, but outside, we remain the same, as witness and unaffected. But we have no escape from flowing inside the main stream. This is how life and time both flows!

Likewise, if you were to stand outside the universe – outside both space and time – and look at your life, you would see your birth, death, process of ageing, and every moment in-between, laid out, as distinct points. From this angle, time does not flow, but is static and fixed. Thus, time in itself is absolute. It means that you find all such transformations in life only in space and time framework, not outside of these.

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Say goodbye to examination anxieties  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">



Although it is common to experience butterflies in the stomach before any major life event, the run up to the final board examinations proves to be a traumatic phase for many students. Tormented by thoughts of failure and of falling short of expectations, they forget how to relax, smile and live normally. Unsurprisingly, many start suffering from a range of physical and psychological problems. As we now move closer to that time of the year, many children and adolescents are feeling petrified, stressed and depressed. How has a routine, periodic assessment turned into a fearsome monster? Reflect deeply and we realise that this is an outcome of our flawed attitudes at a personal and collective level.

During examinations, youngsters, parents and teachers seem to get emotionally carried away, focussing too much on the moment and turning it into a do or die event. They forget that whatever the result, its consequence to the life of the person will never be too significant or irreversible. Looking back at our academic years, most of us would recall excelling in a few examinations, performing averagely in others and failing miserably on some occasions. Did that ever stop us from progressing in our life, living a meaningful existence and fulfilling our vision?



Youngsters and those putting pressure on them to perform need to look at this bigger picture and ease up. While students must immerse themselves whole-heartedly in their studies, giving too much importance to such routine assessments is not warranted. Never worry about scores because life continues to give everyone multiple opportunities to realise their dreams.

Nowadays, an increasing sense of competitiveness pervades our mind, relationships and society. The need to outperform others, flaunt one’s achievements, and to be the best has spread like an epidemic and children are encouraged to internalise it. They grow up with the irrational belief that in order to live a decent life, they must defeat everyone around them. And that’s why their mind misperceives an innocuous evaluation to be a battleground.

Taoist Lao Tzu teaches us the virtue of non-competition. According to him, the wise ones are those who dream big, love to succeed and put their heart and soul in whatever they do but they do all this in a spirit of play. In a similar vein, students should let examinations help them in their self-growth – preparing their best for the examinations, working hard towards their goals, challenging themselves and overcoming their limitations but doing all this in a fun way, enjoying and relishing each moment. If failure happens, don’t lose hope. Take it as a learning opportunity and try playing better strokes next time.

We rarely encourage youngsters to surrender and feel the connection with the Divine. As a result, they often believe that they are all alone in the world without any consistent support. During stressful times, this makes them feel very anxious and vulnerable. If they were to deepen their trust in the Divine, they will feel reassured, knowing that a powerful and benevolent presence is eternally there to help and guide them. Remember that whatever the outcome, Divine Grace will continue empowering you to evolve and make progress. Therefore, keep your faith, rise above your examination anxieties and breathe freely.

<div id="past">
<blockquote>
<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Obedience to the past is disorder  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">


Except perhaps in nature, when you look around, you see that there is much misery, confusion and violence. If man had set out deliberately to bring about chaos in the world, he could not possibly have succeeded as much as the present actual state of destruction, hatred and anarchy. This is the result of the lives, attitudes, values and superstitions of past generations.

You often hear that the future is in the hands of the younger generation. Is this so? Or is it that younger generations are also so heavily conditioned by the past – of which they may not be conscious at all – that they revolt only superficially against the established order? This superficial revolt gives them a certain vitality and freshness which is mistaken for a new beginning. Every generation has been more or less in revolt against the past, but they are soon trapped by the past, by the society, culture in which they have lived.



Every one of us has to think, act and live in a totally different way that is not based on aggression, acquisitiveness and the predatory instinct that man has inherited. This revolution is not in the social or economic field but at a much greater depth; it is in the very structure of human consciousness. So the crisis is not one of youth against former generations, or one religious formula against another, or one country against another, but at the very root of our being. The decision is whether we continue with the past or find a way of living in which conflict in any form does not exist.

To find a new way of life, order is necessary. Order is not imitation or acceptance of a pattern as a way of life. It is not obedience to a higher authority, whether that authority is outer or inner. Order is not conformity either to a way of life established through tradition or to a way of life cultivated for oneself. All such order is essentially a form of acceptance of conformity. Order cannot possibly exist when there is fear; fear and disorder go together. The social structure in which we live, by its very nature, produces this disorder. It is this disorder that we are frightened of … our so-called morality is no more than adjustment to disorder.

When we talk of order we mean a state of mind that is the natural outcome of understanding the actual nature of disorder. It is not the cultivation of a new pattern or system to be followed; rather, it is seeing the nature of disorder and its danger. Freedom does not come from discipline as it is generally understood, which is to conform, to suppress, to obey, and so on. Discipline means learning. So you have to become a disciple of freedom; and there is no guru to tell you what freedom is. So order is possible only when there is learning about freedom. This learning is the continuation of freedom in action.

So authority comes to an end. Of course there must be the authority of the policeman and the law, but there is no other authority. For freedom, which is order, cannot exist in the shadow of authority, whether it is the authority of tradition or the authority that one has gathered through experience and knowledge. Authority is always the past, and obedience to the past is disorder.

<div id="dreams">
<blockquote>
<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;">Dreams, mirages, appearances and reality   </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">

Timeless Being-ness is verily the eternal ground of all the diversity that you see. The appearance of this infinitely variegated ‘many’ is like the reality of your dream, which is rejected when you wake up. This infinite variety is like the mirage that is seen by the traveller in the desert. It is a very real appearance, but an appearance, nonetheless. The reality of this variegated phenomenal exhibition in front of us is the same reality as the ‘castles,’ ‘mountains’ and ‘flying objects’ that you seem to see in the clouds that form in the sky.



This is the nature of this outer appearance, but can you attribute reality to an unreality, to an appearance? Unless you are able to grasp and understand the fact of its unsubstantial nothingness, you will be hypnotised and enslaved by it. You are completely overwhelmed by its apparent sense of reality, and if you are held down in this level of erroneous perception, the cognising of something higher becomes impossible.

As long as you are seeing everything through tinted glasses, you can never get the actual view of things as they are. To see things as they are, remove the tinted glasses and look with clear perception. You have to strip off the veil and see things in their actuality. If you wish to rise up into a higher state of clarified perception, it is imperative to perceive the emptiness and transitory nature of appearances and to understand them as such.

As long as the world is real to you, Brahmn is unreal to you. If you wish to get even a little glimpse of the reality of transcendental truth, you have to recognise the unreality of this universal perception. Until slumber is cast aside, the sleeper cannot be awake. You are either awake or you are asleep. You cannot be in deep sleep and say, “I am awake.” There is the philosophical need of clearly perceiving this phenomenal appearance for what it is.

Adi Shankaracharya and other great philosophers used reasoning, logic and analogy to break the delusion, bit-by-bit, of regarding this world as real. They wanted to completely destroy this deep delusion in which the individual soul is firmly caught. The whole of Shankara’s philosophy is dedicated to making it as clear as daylight that in reality, all is passing appearance and that nothing exists as an unchanging and eternal reality.

The statement, “Nothing exists, nothing belongs to me,” dismisses the actuality of all appearances. Once you dismiss the apparent universe and erase it from your consciousness, you turn your attention to yourself. “I am neither mind nor body. I am not the psychological or the physical personality. I have no name, no form; immortal Self am I.” In that state of existence that is the nondual state of consciousness, time does not exist. Eternity alone remains – an undivided eternity in which everything is only now. In that now, Being-ness is forever in the present tense.
That eternity, that forever-now, is the basis of being. It is the unbroken, continuous stream of consciousness, and that is the basis of your being. It is the substratum upon which, waking, dreaming, sleeping – and once again waking, dreaming, sleeping over and over again – come, change and disappear. This cycle of waking, dreaming, sleeping is forever manifesting itself upon that unbroken inner current of eternal consciousness. (Divine Life Society)

<h1 style="font-size:300%; font-family:verdana; color:yellow;"> Family as the primary agency of peace  </h1>
<p style="font-size:180%; font-family:courier; color:white;">


Most of us begin our lives in a family, once we leave the warmth and security of the mother’s womb. Along with basic necessities, an average family provides love and care, so crucial to a growing child. We know deep inside that whatever we are today, is due, in large measure, to the upbringing and values we imbibe from immediate and extended families, and from those who we consider ‘family’, outside the home. Some seek out a spiritual mentor who they can engage with for life guidance. So besides nature, nurture plays a crucial role in shaping our personality, attitude and behaviour that get reflected in our daily conduct.

Our upbringing and the associations we make (satsang), do influence our attitude and behaviour. It is from these ‘families’ that we acquire, by osmosis, an understanding of ethical and moral values and principles, also depending on the prevailing socio-political context. Hence, the tendency for peace-promoters to routinely quote from the Maha Upanishad that says, ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ – the whole world, the entire earth and all that is in it, is my family.

Interestingly, this phrase is engraved on the entrance to Parliament in New Delhi, perhaps to inspire legislators to always remember that despite all the diversity and differences, we need to discuss, debate and resolve issues, form policies and pass laws in the spirit of being one family. Why? Because by and large, no one would wish to harm his family and so would not take any step that would mean inflicting violence or aggravating conflict in the family. The effort would always be to love one’s family members and work towards maintaining peace and happiness in the household.



So, when we extend the concept of family from one’s hearth to one’s homeland and beyond, it is only logical to assume that as members of one large earth family, we will act responsibly and love one another in the same spirit as do members of the smaller family unit. Hence we often say, that the family is the cradle of peace – all fundamental value systems, love and togetherness, caring and sharing, all emanate from that cradle.

At the risk of oversimplification, one could ask, could the breakdown in the family as a cradle of peace – in some cases – be due to the fact that increasingly, children spend most of their time alone, left to their own devices, consuming negative narratives on multi-media? And parents, to assuage their guilt for not being able to spend enough quality time with their children, end up giving in to their every wish and demand, ply them with expensive gifts and hesitate to discipline them when required, for fear of losing their love?

Maulana Wahiduddin Khan says that instead of over-protecting and pampering their children, and putting pressure on them to only excel in material spheres, parents need to nourish them with spiritual values that will contribute to their all-round well-being and prepare them to participate in creating a peaceful and loving world. The family is the microcosm that gets reflected in the macrocosm; it is the “experimental field of non-violence”, as Acharya Mahaprajna put it.

Relationships formed with selflessness and affection will engender non-violence, while relationships formed with selfish motives breed violence.
