        <br>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said it is for the first time in the history of independent India that a pro-incumbency wave has enveloped the nation.</br>
        <br>"Several polls have taken place in our country, but after this election, the political pundits will be baffled because it is for the first time in the history of independent India, that the wave of pro-incumbency has enveloped the nation," said Prime Minister Narendra Modi while interacting with his party cadres in Varanasi on Friday.

He also lauded the party workers and said it for their hard work that people of the nation are saying "phir ek baar Modi sarkar."</br>

         <br>"The massive turn out in yesterday's road show was an example of your (BJP workers) hardwork. We have won the Varanasi yesterday, now we have to win polling booths set up across the constituency. I have never let my inner worker die. I am equally vigilant in my responsibility as a Prime Minister, an MP and a BJP worker," the Prime Minister further stated.

"I am proud of our booth workers. They carried our door to door campaigns despite the scorching heat. Yesterday, I saw a family member in every resident of Varanasi," he added.</br>
         
         <br>The Prime Minister further said, "I am not at all concerned about my victory but I am more concerned about the victory of democracy."

He also suggested them to greet the first time voters with flowers and sweets in order to make them feel responsible for shaping the future of the country.

He also said that this Lok Sabha elections he wishes that women voters must outnumber men in Benaras. "I have a wish which I was not able to fulfil in Gujarat. Can the Benaras city fulfil my wish? I want women voters to turn out in more number than men voters."

Varanasi will vote on May 19, the last phase of seven-phased Lok Sabha elections. Uttar Pradesh, where 80 Lok Sabha seats are at stake, is undergoing polls during all seven phases. So far, the election has been held for 26 Lok Sabah seats. The counting of votes will take place on May 23.</br>
<b><h1 ztyle="font-size:300%;">Article 370, 35A Have Done Maximum Damage To Jammu And Kashmir: PM Modi</h1></b>

      <br>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that Article 370 and 35A have done maximum damage to Jammu and Kashmir and only former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's formula of "Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat and Jamhooriyat" will work in Jammu and Kashmir</br>
         <br> He also referred to the BJP's alliance in Jammu and Kashmir with the PDP as 'mahamilawat'.

In an interview to Aaj Tak Hindi news channel, PM Modi said: "Article 370 and 35A have done maximum damage to Kashmir. We set up AIIMS and IIM in Kashmir, but top professors are not ready to go there because they can't buy property there."</br>
      <br>  "The rents there are very high. There is no investment in Jammu and Kashmir because investors feel they would not get land there," he said.

PM Modi pointed out that the youth in Kashmir were not getting jobs. "Kashmir is staring at bankruptcy. Terrorists have finished tourism in the state. There is no investment because of Article 370 and 35A. Now, people in Kashmir feel there is a need for change," he said. </br>

   
   <img src ="http://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2018/story/images/big/the-case-against-article-370-2018-08-21.jpg">
  <br> When asked about the BJP's promise of removing Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution, PM Modi said, "People who talk of secession have no right to fight elections. Jammu and Kashmir has been part of India for thousands of years. Questions should be asked to those who talk about secession." </br>
   <br> "We have an understanding of Jammu and Kashmir and we did not require the experience of being in government for five years as I have worked there in the organisation and I used to go to all parts of the state," he said.

Slamming a few political families in the state, in an apparent dig at the People's Democratic Party and the National Conference in the state, the Prime Minister said: "A small section of families has found the way to blackmail the people of Jammu and Kashmir. When Mufti Mohammed Saeed Saheb was there, we were hopeful."</br>

<br> "But that was our mahamilawat. It was the mixture of oil and water and we did the alliance by saying that we are two poles and we would not be able to mix," he said, referring to the PDP-BJP alliance that has since cracked.

He said there was no other option in Jammu and Kashmir then given the kind of the mandate political parties got in Assembly elections. "And when it mattered for democracy, we came out of the alliance."</br>
<br>PM Modi said a small section of families in Kashmir speaks one thing in the state and another in Delhi. "We need to expose their double standards. I am doing this to expose them. And I am asking them to say the same thing in Delhi that they say in Kashmir."</br>
